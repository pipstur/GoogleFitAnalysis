With the knowledge I have, I tried to find answers to a few questions I've had for some time now. 
There will be more stuff added as I gain more knowledge in the field of Data Science. This has more to do with vizualisations, than it has to do with actual data science.
Using Pandas, matplotlib and some other libraries I built some informative graphs and so on. I should put this in a notebook :D
